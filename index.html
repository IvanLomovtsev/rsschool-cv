    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am a research engineer at an electric power company. I am mainly engaged in mathematical modeling 
        of electric power systems, developing algorithms in Matlab/Simulink and writing technical tasks. 
        I decided to change my activity and become a Frontend developer. Now I am actively studying HTML, 
        CSS and Javascript. I devote as much time as possible to studying and I believe that I will succeed. 
        I love working in a team and always love to learn something new.
